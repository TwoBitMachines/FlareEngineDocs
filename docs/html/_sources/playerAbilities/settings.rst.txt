   * - Jump
     - These two fields are required to calculate the player's gravity. Time specifies the total duration of the jump, and Height specifies
       how high the player can jump.

   * - Climb Slopes
     - If enabled,the player will be able to climb slopes. Specify the maximum slope that can be climbed (89 degrees will the absolute maximum).

   * - Rotate To Slope
     - If climbing slopes, this will rotate the player so that it's completely perpendicular to the ground.

   * - Rectify In Air
     - If the player becomes rotated while climbing a slope, this will rotate the player to the nearest square axis if the player jumps.

   * - Use Bridges
     - If enabled,the player will be able to walk on bridges.

   * - Use Moving Platforms
     - If enabled, moving platforms will be able to detect the player.
