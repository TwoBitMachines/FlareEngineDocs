   * - Property
     - 

   * - Target
     - The transform the camera will follow.

   * - Speed
     - The follow speed. If smoothing is 1, the follow speed will be instant in that direction.

   * - Smooth X
     - The smoothing effect in the x-direction.

   * - Smooth Y
     - The smoothing effect in the y-direction.
  
   * - Clamp
     - If enabled, these bounds will clamp the world position of an orthographic camera. Modify the blue gizmo in the scene 
       to specify this area. 

Parallax
========

Create a parallax effect with infinite scrolling. Add the number of parallax layers necessary by clicking the 
add button. Each layer added will correspond to a game object. Once you create the game objects, add a Sprite Renderer to each one
and set the Order In Layer manually. 

In the inspector, set the reference and the parallax rate, which is the rate at which 
the layer will move with the camera. A value of 1 means the layer moves exactly with the camera. This is 
typically the value for the farthest layer, the background. A value of zero means the layer is standing completely still. 
This is typically the value of the nearest layer, the foreground. The parallax rate for the y values should typically be smaller than the 
x values.

These layers can be organized outside the camera game object. That is, they are not required to be children of the camera.
